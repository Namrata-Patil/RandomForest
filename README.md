# RandomForest
This repositary consists of implementation of Random Forest Classifier. Please note this is a very basic/beginner level code.

Random Forest Classifier is a method that operates by consulting multiple decision trees during training phase. The decison of the trees is chosen by the random forst as the final decion.

There are tones of videos/turtorials that explain the working of Random Forests.

The dataset used for this is the "Iris" dataset.

You can find it [here] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), or if you are familiar with sklearn.datasets, you can find it there too!
